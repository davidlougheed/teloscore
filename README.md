# TeloScore

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.14984162.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14984162)

A telomeric allele comparison-scoring tool for output from [Telogator2](https://github.com/zstephens/telogator2).


## Installation

TeloScore can be installed from PyPI using the following command:

```bash
pip install teloscore
```


## Usage

The following is an example showing how TeloScore is to be used:

```bash
teloscore compare ./sample_01_child.tsv ./sample_02_parent_1.tsv ./out.tsv
```

> Note: There are currently two scoring systems: `1` and `2`, corresponding 
> to the scoring systems found in the v0.1.x release and the v0.2.x release.
> The default is `2`. You may specify which scoring system you wish to use
> by passing `--scoring #`, where `#` is `1` or `2`.

The output matrix can then be plotted using the following command:

```bash
teloscore plot ./out.tsv
```


## Input Format

TeloScore's `compare` subcommand is primarily designed to accept the 
[TSV output file from Telogator2](https://github.com/zstephens/telogator2?tab=readme-ov-file#output-files).
However, any TSV file with the following columns would work:

* `#chr` / `chr`: Chromosome arm
* `allele_id`: ID for this specific allele (see Telogator2)
* `tvr_consensus`: Allele TVR consensus sequence, in the Telogator2 base encoding 
  (https://github.com/zstephens/telogator2/blob/main/resources/kmers.tsv)


## Output Format

**Definition:** TVR = telomere variable region

The output is a TSV matrix with the TVR of the first sample (child) across the 
columns, and those of the second sample (parent) across the rows. Each entry in
the matrix is a floating-point number between 0 and 1, representing a custom 
similarity score between the two TVRs.
